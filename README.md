## Password-Protected Divisor Finder Program

Welcome to our Password-Protected Divisor Finder Program! This program requires users to enter a pre-known password, which is Ehsan12345 in this case, to access its functionality. Once authenticated, the program allows users to input a number, and it will then calculate and display the divisors of that number. The user can choose to pick another number or finish the program.

Version 2 bug: After entering 'n' or 'N,' the program continues to accept input from the user.
Version 3 bug: After entering any character except 'n,' 'y,' 'N,' or 'Y,' the program displays an error message but still accepts input.
