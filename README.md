## Password-Protected Divisor Finder Program

Welcome to our Password-Protected Divisor Finder Program! This program requires users to enter a pre-known password, which is Ehsan12345 in this case, to access its functionality. Once authenticated, the program allows users to input a number, and it will then calculate and display the divisors of that number. The user can choose to pick another number or finish the program.

**How it works:**

1. **Password Entry:**
   - You need to enter the pre-known password to access the program.

2. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - After entering the correct password, you can input a number of your choice.
   - The program will then calculate and display the divisors of the entered number.

3. **Continuation or Finish:**
   - After seeing the divisors, you can decide if you want to pick another number or finish the program.

We hope you find this program useful and engaging. Feel free to contribute or provide feedback to help us improve it.
